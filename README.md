# The GitHub Temporal Correction Initiative
An opinionated browser extension committed to restoring chronological integrity on GitHub.

## Mission Statement
To correct a long-standing temporal anomaly: GitHub’s insistence that weeks begin on Sunday.

## Why? Because Sunday is the End, Not the Beginning.
Look, we're all busy coding, but we must adhere to basic temporal logic. The contribution graph is a gorgeous heatmap of productivity, but every time you see that Sunday row sitting stubbornly at the top, a tiny piece of your fastidious soul withers.

This is the standard: Monday is the start of the week. It's the morning the alarm clock screams that the weekend is done and your caffeine reserves must be replenished. Sunday is the final sanctuary, the last moment of peace before the cycle of contribution begins anew.

This extension is a small act of rebellion against chronological chaos.

## Features (The Simple Fix)
### Chronological Correction:
Moves the entire Sunday row to the bottom of the contribution grid.
### Visual Alignment:
Automatically shifts the contribution squares and reveals the "Sun" label for perfect, Monday-aligned symmetry.
### Zero Configuration:
Installs silently, works automatically. Just open a GitHub profile and enjoy the peace.
