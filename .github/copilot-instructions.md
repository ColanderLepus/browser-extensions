# ðŸ¦¾ Copilot Instructions for Contribution Graph Realignment Tool

## Project Overview
This is a browser extension (manifest v3) that realigns GitHub's contribution graph so the week starts on Monday, not Sunday. The extension operates automatically on GitHub profile pages, moving the Sunday row to the bottom of the graph for improved chronological accuracy.

## Architecture & Key Files
- `extension/manifest.json`: Declares the extension, content script, and icon. Only `content.js` runs on GitHub pages.
- `extension/content.js`: Main logic. Uses DOM manipulation and a MutationObserver to reorder the contribution graph table. No background scripts, options, or popup UI.
- `README.md`: Explains the mission and principles. The project is intentionally minimal and focused.

## Critical Patterns & Conventions
- **Silent Correction:** All changes are automatic; no user configuration or UI.
- **DOM Manipulation:** The script targets `.ContributionCalendar-grid` tables, moving the first row (Sunday) to the end, and fixes label visibility.
- **MutationObserver:** Ensures the correction persists through page navigation and dynamic updates.
- **Idempotency:** The script marks tables with `dataset.weekMondayCorrected` to avoid repeated changes.
- **URL Change Handling:** Uses both `popstate` and polling to detect navigation and reapply corrections.
- **No External Dependencies:** Pure JavaScript, no frameworks or libraries.

## Developer Workflows
- **Build/Test:** No build step; edit files directly. Test by loading the unpacked extension in Chrome/Edge and visiting GitHub profiles.
- **Debugging:** Use browser DevTools to inspect the DOM and verify table manipulation. Reload the extension after changes.
- **Release:** Update `manifest.json` version, zip the `extension/` folder, and upload to the browser extension store.

## Integration Points
- **GitHub Profile Pages:** Only runs on URLs matching `https://github.com/*`.
- **Contribution Graph Table:** Script expects a 7-row table structure. If GitHub changes their DOM, update selectors and logic accordingly.

## Examples
- To add new correction logic, extend `startWeekOnMonday(table)` in `content.js`.
- To support other sites, add URL patterns in `manifest.json`.

## Key Directories
- `extension/`: All source code and assets.
